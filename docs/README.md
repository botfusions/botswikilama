# Research & References

Academic papers and research documents that influenced and continue to guide Lemma's development.

## Memory & Continual Learning

- **[Self-Distillation Enables Continual Learning](./Self-Distillation%20Enables%20Continual%20Learning.md)** — Core inspiration for Lemma's guide distillation system (`guide_distill`). Raw memory fragments are compressed into reusable procedural knowledge, mirroring self-distillation in neural networks.
- **[AgeMem: Agentic Memory Framework](./AgeMem-Agentic-Memory-Framework.md)** — Informed the biological memory model (confidence decay, access-based reinforcement, negative feedback). Lemma's `decayConfidence` / `boostOnAccess` / `recordNegativeHit` cycle directly reflects this research.

## Self-Refinement & Iterative Improvement

- **[Self-Refine: Iterative Refinement with Self-Feedback](./Self-Refine_-Iterative-Refinement-with-Self-Feedback.txt)** — Basis for the feedback loop where LLMs evaluate and improve their own outputs. Relevant to `memory_feedback` (positive/negative) and guide improvement suggestions.
- **[Learning to Refine: Self-Refinement of Parallel Reasoning](./Learning%20to%20Refine_%20Self-Refinement%20of%20Parallel%20Reasoning%20in%20LLMs.txt)** — Parallel reasoning patterns informed multi-fragment association tracking (`trackAssociations`).
- **[SSR: Socratic Self-Refine for LLM Reasoning](./SSR_%20Socratic%20Self-Refine%20for%20Large%20Language%20Model%20Reasoning.txt)** — Question-driven self-improvement inspired the audit system (`memory_audit`) that identifies gaps and contradictions.
- **[Enhancing LLM Planning through Intrinsic Self-Critique](./Enhancing%20LLM%20Planning%20Capabilities%20through%20Intrinsic%20Self-Critique.txt)** — Self-critique mechanisms informed session outcome tracking and guide success rate analysis.
- **[Evolving LLMs' Self-Refinement via Synergistic Training-Inference](./Evolving%20LLMs%20Self-Refinement%20Capability%20via%20Synergistic%20Training-Inference%20Optimization.txt)** — Synergy between training and inference optimization informed the dual-path memory system (static facts via memories + procedural skills via guides).

## LLM Inference & Improvement

- **[A Survey on LLM Inference-Time Self-Improvement](./A%20Survey%20on%20LLM%20Inference-Time%20Self-Improvement.txt)** — Comprehensive survey covering techniques that informed the overall architecture of persistent memory as an inference-time enhancement.
- **[2603.19461v1](./2603.19461v1.txt)** — Additional research on LLM capability enhancement during inference.

## Architecture References

- **[llm-wiki](./llm-wiki.md)** — Karpathy's LLM Wiki pattern. Inspired `memory_audit` (wiki health-check), universal memory injection (always-available knowledge), and the 3-layer injection architecture.
- **[self-improvement-architecture](./self-improvement-architecture.md)** — Internal design notes mapping research concepts to Lemma's implementation.

| Knowledge compounding | `guide_merge` / `memory_merge` — consolidation |
| Always-available knowledge | Universal tool description injection |
| Session-based learning | `session_start` / `session_end` + virtual sessions |
