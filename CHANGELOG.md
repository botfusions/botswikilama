## [0.6.0] - 2026-04-18

### Inspired by Karpathy's LLM Wiki
- **Lint concept** — `memory_audit` tool inspired by Karpathy's wiki health-check idea (contradictions, orphans, gaps)
- **Always-available knowledge** — Universal tool description injection ensures memories are in LLM context without explicit tool calls

### Added
- **Universal Memory Injection** — Memories are now injected into tool descriptions via `tools/list`, guaranteeing ALL MCP clients (opencode, Claude Desktop, Cursor, VS Code, Gemini CLI) see full memory content without requiring explicit tool calls.
  - Top N memories injected as full content into `memory_read` tool description (~4000 tokens budget)
  - Remaining memories shown as compact index
  - Top 5 guides shown with learnings
  - Dual injection: `instructions` field (for clients that support it) + tool descriptions (universal fallback)
- **Config System** (`~/.lemma/config.json`) — User-configurable token budgets and injection limits
  - `token_budget.full_content` (default: 3000)
  - `token_budget.summary_index` (default: 1000)
  - `token_budget.guides_detail` (default: 1000)
  - `injection.max_full_content_fragments` (default: 15)
  - `virtual_session.timeout_minutes` (default: 30)
- **Virtual Session Tracking** (`src/sessions/virtual.js`) — Automatic session correlation without requiring explicit `session_start`/`session_end`
  - Auto-starts on first tool call, auto-finalizes after 30 min inactivity
  - Tracks tool calls, technologies seen, guides used, memories created/accessed
  - Sessions persisted to `~/.lemma/sessions/` as JSON files
  - `session_stats` tool to view virtual session statistics
- **3-Layer Injection Architecture** — `buildDynamicInstructions` rewritten with:
  - Layer 1: Base rules (~500 tokens)
  - Layer 2: Full content for high-confidence memories (token-budgeted)
  - Layer 3: Summary index for remaining memories
  - Layer 4: Active guides with descriptions
- **MCP Resource Notifications** — `notifications/resources/updated` sent after every memory change
  - New `lemma://context/current` resource with dynamically generated context
  - Clients that support resource subscriptions get live updates
- **`session_stats` tool** — View virtual session activity, technologies, and guide usage

### Changed
- **`ListToolsRequestSchema` handler** — Now dynamically builds tool descriptions with injected memory context on every `tools/list` call
- **System prompt** — Added `<critical_rules>` section with mandatory behavior rules (always call `memory_read` first, always call `memory_add` after learning)
- **`buildDynamicInstructions`** — Removed redundant `decayConfidence` call (already applied at startup)

---

## [0.5.0] - 2026-04-18

### Breaking Changes
- **JSR support removed** — `jsr.json` deleted. Use `npx -y github:xenitV1/lemma` instead of `npx -y jsr @lemma/lemma`.

### Fixed
- **Critical: memory_read was destructive** — Decay was applied and saved on every `memory_read` call, causing confidence death spiral. Decay now only persists at session boundary (`initializeContext` on startup). Read operations no longer modify confidence.
- **Critical: Jaccard dedup was semantically broken** — "Use React hooks" vs "Don't use React hooks" scored 0.75 (blocked as duplicate). Replaced with Fuse.js fuzzy matching at threshold 0.65 for accurate similarity detection.
- **Critical: No concurrent write protection** — Added module-level write lock (`saveMemorySafe`) to prevent data loss from overlapping writes.
- **High: Double context injection** — Both `buildDynamicInstructions` and `getDynamicSystemPrompt` produced overlapping data with double decay. Resource handler now returns static `BASE_SYSTEM_PROMPT` only. Dynamic context via initialize `instructions` is the single source.
- **High: User memories bypassed dedup** — `source === "ai"` check meant user duplicates were never caught. Dedup now applies to all sources.
- **High: Guide dedup missing** — "react", "reactjs", "react.js" created 3 separate guides. Added `findSimilarGuide` with Fuse.js fuzzy matching.
- **High: ID collision risk** — 6 hex chars (16M space, 50% collision at ~4,800 IDs). Replaced with `crypto.randomUUID`-based 12 hex chars (281 trillion space).
- **Redundant decay in buildDynamicInstructions** — Was applying decay a second time after `applySessionDecay` already ran on startup. Removed.

### Added
- **`memory_stats` tool** — Fragment counts, average confidence, project breakdown, high/low confidence counts.
- **`memory_audit` tool** — Integrity check for orphan references, duplicate IDs, confidence anomalies, malformed entries.
- **Batch read support** — `memory_read` now accepts `ids: string[]` for fetching multiple fragment details in one call.
- **`outcome` parameter on `guide_practice`** — Track success/failure rate without requiring session_end.
- **`guide_update` expanded** — Now supports `add_anti_patterns`, `add_pitfalls`, `superseded_by`, `deprecated` fields.
- **`<critical_rules>` in system prompt** — Mandatory behavior rules forcing LLM to always call `memory_read` first and `memory_add` after learning.
- **File locking** — `writeLock`/`writeQueue` mechanism prevents overlapping writes within same process.

### Changed
- **System prompt slimmed** — From ~1,300 tokens to ~500 tokens. Removed philosophical framing ("Recursive Cognitive Engine", "Agentic Sovereignty"). Kept operational instructions.
- **Compact formatting** — Replaced box-drawing characters (╔═══╗║╚╝) with simple markdown headers. Removed 14-space alignment padding.
- **`guide_practice` returns compact response** — One-liner confirmation instead of echoing full guide detail.
- **`guide_merge` merges all array fields** — Now also merges `anti_patterns` and `known_pitfalls`, not just contexts/learnings.
- **Dead guide fields removed** — `feedback_patterns` and `improvement_log` were never populated by any tool. Removed from schema.
- **Session tracking** — Added `session_start`/`session_end` tools with guide suggestions, success rate tracking, and improvement detection.
- **Feedback counters** — Memory fragments now track `positive_feedback` and `negative_feedback` counts.

### Removed
- **JSR support** — `jsr.json` deleted. README updated to show GitHub npx as sole installation method.
- **`calculateSimilarity` (Jaccard)** — Replaced entirely by Fuse.js-based `findSimilarFragment`.

### Tests
- All 110 tests passing. Fixed broken assertions (`filterByProject` count, `findSimilarFragment` threshold, system prompt title).

---

## [0.3.2] - 2026-03-20

### Changed
- **Simplified decay formula** — Removed `time_multiplier` and `negativeHitMultiplier` from `decayConfidence()`. Decay is now a flat rate based only on access frequency: `max(0.005, 0.05 - accessed * 0.005)`. Negative feedback still reduces confidence directly via `memory_feedback` (-0.1), but no longer accelerates decay over time.

## [0.3.1] - 2026-03-19

### Fixed
- **Critical: Memory data loss in `memory_read`** — Accessing memory within a project scope was mistakenly overwriting the main file with only the filtered project fragments, deleting all global and other project data. Fixed by separating full and filtered memory arrays during the save process.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-03-19

### Added
- **Memory Learning System** — Fragments now gain confidence when actively used, not just decay slower
  - `boostOnAccess()`: +0.1 confidence per use (max 1.0), context tagging, access counter
  - `recordNegativeHit()`: -0.1 confidence when memory is unhelpful, negative hit counter
  - `trackAssociations()`: Bidirectional cross-references between co-accessed fragments
  - New fragment fields: `tags`, `associatedWith`, `negativeHits`
- **`memory_feedback` Tool** — Provide positive/negative feedback on memory fragments after use
- **`memory_read` context parameter** — Tag fragments with usage context (e.g., "debugging", "refactoring") for future recall
- **Test Suite** — 90 tests covering all modules (memory core, guides core, handlers, learning lifecycle) with full I/O isolation

### Changed
- **Decay now factors negative hits** — Fragments marked unhelpful decay faster via `negativeHitMultiplier`
- **Negative hits reset per session** — Like `accessed`, `negativeHits` resets after each decay cycle
- **`saveMemory` / `saveGuides` accept `force` option** — Allows intentional empty array saves (for deletion operations)
- **`formatMemoryDetail`** — Shows `tags` and `associatedWith` fields when present

### Fixed
- **`handleMemoryForget`** — Saving empty array after deleting last fragment now works (was silently blocked by safety check)
- **`handleGuideForget`** — Same fix for guides deletion

## [0.2.3] - 2026-03-19

### Fixed
- **Critical: Memory data loss from decay** — `decayConfidence()` was permanently removing fragments with confidence below 0.1 from disk. Decay now only reduces confidence scores; fragments are never removed implicitly. Deletion is exclusive to `memory_forget` and `memory_merge` (explicit user actions).
- **Critical: Backup overwrite on same-count save** — When new data had the same number of entries as the backup but different IDs, the backup was silently overwritten, losing unique entries. Backup is now cumulative (ID-based merge) — it only adds new entries and never removes existing ones.
- **Critical: Backup overwrite after count recovery** — After decay reduced entries and new additions brought the count back up, the backup was overwritten with data missing decayed entries. Cumulative backup prevents this entirely.
- **saveMemory(null/undefined/[]) protection** — Empty, null, or undefined arrays are now rejected before writing, preventing accidental file wipe.

### Changed
- **Backup system rewritten** — Both `memory.jsonl.bak` and `guides.jsonl.bak` now use cumulative merging instead of overwrite. The backup grows over time but never loses entries.
- **Test suite added** — Comprehensive memory test suite (110 tests) covering all tools, decay behavior, backup safety, and data loss scenarios.

## [0.2.2] - 2026-03-18

### Added
- **memory_merge Tool**: Merge multiple memory fragments into one to consolidate duplicates. Creates new ID, deletes originals.
- **guide_merge Tool**: Merge multiple guides into one. Auto-merges contexts, learnings, and sums usage counts.
- **Auto-backup**: Both `memory.jsonl` and `guides.jsonl` are automatically backed up to `.bak` on every save.

### Changed
- **System Prompt**: Rewritten identity section — clearer, explanatory, non-mandatory tone
- **System Prompt**: Expanded guide tracking section with detailed explanations (memory vs guide, categories, merge tools)
- **System Prompt**: Added "Discovering Technologies" recommendation for manual project analysis via `package.json`

### Removed
- **guide_discover Tool**: Removed in favor of manual discovery. System prompt now recommends reading `package.json` directly and using `guide_practice` to register technologies.

  - `list_resources` returns each record with metadata (title, description, scope)
  - `read_resource` fetches only the requested single record
- **New URI Patterns**:
  - `lemma://memory/{id}` - Single memory fragment by ID
  - `lemma://skills/{name}` - Single skill by name
